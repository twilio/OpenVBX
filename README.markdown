# Contributing to OpenVBX

When working on OpenVBX try to work on the develop branch. This is where 
all work is done before being completed and merged in to master. No work 
goes directly to master.

To open a pull request against OpenVBX open it from your develop branch 
on to the main develop branch. We will end up pulling any requests 
against master in to a feature branch off of develop before merging the 
pull request.
